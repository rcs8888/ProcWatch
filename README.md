*A tool designed for collecting and analyzing process information with machine learning.*

Welcome to ProcWatch! This project is a work in progress.

## Features
- Real-time process monitoring feature
- Machine learning based anomaly scoring
- Heuristic detection layer for suspicious behavior
- JSON logging
- Anomaly generation scripts for basic testing

## Usage
*Once again this is a work in progress.* 
1. Begin recording process information:
   ```python python3 process_collector.py```
2. If using the tool for simulated anomaly detection/research, scripts are provided. Run in a seperate terminal:
   ```python python3 spawn_children_anomaly.py```
3.
