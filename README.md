# ProcWatch👁️‍🗨️
*A tool designed for collecting and analyzing process information with machine learning.*

Welcome to ProcWatch! This project is a work in progress. No promises that anything works as intended!

## Features
- Real-time process monitoring feature
- Machine learning based anomaly scoring
- Heuristic detection layer for suspicious behavior
- JSON logging
- Anomaly generation scripts for basic testing

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcs8888/ProcWatch.git
cd ProcWatch
```
## Usage
1. Begin recording process information:
```python
python3 process_collector.py
```
2. If using the tool for simulated anomaly detection/research, scripts are provided. Run in a seperate terminal:
```python
python3 spawn_children_anomaly.py
```
