# ProcWatch
A tool designed for collecting and analyzing process information with machine learning.

Welcome to ProcWatch! This project is a work in progress. Here are the initial steps for data collection:
1. Run "python3 process_collector.py" to begin recording process information.
2. If using the tool for simulated anomaly detection, scripts are provided. A good starting point is running "python3 spawn_children_anomaly.py"
